Day5:-
Task 1:- Create Directories Using Shell Script:
•	Write a bash script createDirectories.sh that, when executed with three arguments (directory name, start number of directories, and end number of directories), creates a specified number of directories with a dynamic directory name.
•	Example 1: When executed as ./createDirectories.sh day 1 90, it creates 90 directories as day1 day2 day3 ... day90.
•	Example 2: When executed as ./createDirectories.sh Movie 20 50, it creates 31 directories as Movie20 Movie21 Movie22 ... Movie50.
Solution :- 
      #!/bin/bash

            if [ "$#" -ne 3 ]; then
                    echo "Usage: $0 Movies 20 50"
                    exit 1
            fi
            
            #assign argument to variables
            
            Movie=$1
            start=$2
            end=$3
            
            for((i=$start; i<=$end; i++))
                    do
                       dir="$Movie$i"
                       mkdir -p "$dir"
                       echo "created directory: $dir"
                    done
            
            echo "All directories are created sucessfully ....!"

Task2:- Create a Script to Backup All Your Work:
•	Backups are an important part of a DevOps Engineer's day-to-day activities. The video in the references will help you understand how a DevOps Engineer takes backups (it can feel a bit difficult but keep trying, nothing is impossible).
      #!/bin/bash

        #variables
        backup_dir="/root"
        
        ts=$(date +"%y%m%d_%H%M%S")
        
        backup_file="${backup_dir}/backup_${ts}.tar.gz"
        
        tar -czf $backwqup_file /root/backup
        
        echo "backup created $backup_file"

Task 3:- Read About Cron and Crontab to Automate the Backup Script:
o	Cron is the system's main scheduler for running jobs or tasks unattended. A command called crontab allows the user to submit, edit, or delete entries to cron. A crontab file is a user file that holds the scheduling information. 

*/1 * * * * bash /home/ubuntu/scripts/backup.sh

Task 4: Read About User Management:
•	A user is an entity in a Linux operating system that can manipulate files and perform several other operations. Each user is assigned an ID that is unique within the system. IDs 0 to 999 are assigned to system users, and local user IDs start from 1000 onwards.
•	Create 2 users and display their usernames.
              #!/bin/bash
              
              #create User using .sh
              
              useradd Jaksh
              useradd TWS
              useradd gujrathis
              
              echo "All users are created sucessfully"
              
              cat /etc/passwd
