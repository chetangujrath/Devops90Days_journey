Day 8 Shell Scripting Challenge
  Task 1 :- Comments
      In bash scripts, comments are used to add explanatory notes or disable certain lines of code. Your task is to create a 
      bash script with comments explaining what the script does.
            #!/bin/bash
              #
              #
              echo "This is single line comment below in linux"
              
              echo "# this is single line comment.... !"
              
              echo "This is multiline comment in linux"
              
              echo "<<comment this is multiline comment  \n
                      comment here is \n
                      comment>>"
  Task 2: Echo
      The echo command is used to display messages on the terminal. Your task is to create a bash script that uses echo to print a message of your choice.

        #!/bin/bash
        #this is echo example in linux
        echo "This is the echo statement in the 8th days task "
        echo""
        echo "We will display the current date and time"
        echo ""
        date
        echo ""
        echo "Thanks for checking.....!"

  Task 3: Variables
      Variables in bash are used to store data and can be referenced by their name. Your task is to create a bash script that declares variables and assigns 
        values to them.
        #!/bin/bash
        #
        #We will declare varible with example
        #
        name="Chetan Gujrathi"
        designation="SSE"
        company="Techm"
        
        echo "I am $name and my Post is $designation and working in $company .....!!!!"
        
        echo "Thanks for checking....!!!!"

  Task 4: Using Variables
      Now that you have declared variables, let's use them to perform a simple task. Create a bash script that takes two variables (numbers) as input and prints their 
        sum using those variables.
        #!/bin/bash
        #
        #
        #We will perform the mathematical operation in this script with example
            
        n1=15
        n2=60
        echo "This is the addition example...!!!"
        echo ""
        add=$((n1 + n2))
        echo ""
        echo "The Addition of $n1 and $n2 is equal to $add ..."
        echo ""
        echo "This is the Substraction example... !!!"
        echo""
        sub=$((n2 - n1))
        echo "The substraction of $n2 and $n1 is equal to $sub ..."
        echo ""
Task 5: Using Built-in Variables
        Bash provides several built-in variables that hold useful information. Your task is to create a bash script that utilizes at least three different built-in 
        variables to display relevant information.

        #!/bin/bash
        #
        #
        echo "Specifies directories where the system looks for executable files. $PATH"
        echo ""
        echo "Contains the current logged-in username. .. $USER"
        echo""
        echo "Displays the current working directory. $PWD"
        echo ""
        echo "Display curent userid $UID"
        echo "Thanks for checking ....!!!!"
Task 6: Wildcards
        Wildcards are special characters used to perform pattern matching when working with files. Your task is to create a bash script that utilizes wildcards 
        to list all the files with a specific extension in a directory.
              #!/bin/bash
              #
              #we will use wildcard in this example.
              #
              echo "We will use wildcard matching for lsiting file .sh files "
              ls *.sh
