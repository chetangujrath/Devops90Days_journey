Day 9 Answers: Shell Scripting Challenge Directory Backup with Rotation
  Tasks
Challenge Description

Your task is to create a bash script that takes a directory path as a command-line argument and performs a backup of the directory. 
  The script should create timestamped backup folders  and copy all the files from the specified directory into the backup folder.

Additionally, the script should implement a rotation mechanism to keep only the last 3 backups. This means that if there are more 
  than 3 backup folders, the oldest backup folders should be removed to ensure only the most recent backups are retained.

  mkdir backup 
        #!/bin/bash
        #
        #dir path provided as argument
        if [ -z "$1" ] ; then
                echo "Usage: $0 /home/ubuntu/day8"
                exit 1
        fi
        #assign the dir path
        S_DIR="$1"
        
        #check if the directory path is exists.
        if [ ! -d "$S_DIR" ]; then
                echo "The dir $S_DIR does not exist."
                exit 1
        fi
        
        #creater the backup dir if not exist.
        B_DIR="${HOME}/backups"
        mkdir -p "$B_DIR"
        
        #create a timestamp folder for the backup
        TSP=$(date +"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")
        D_DIR="${B_DIR}/backup_${TSP}"
        
        #perform the backup by copying dir
        #
        cp -r "$S_DIR" "$D_DIR"
        
        echo "backup of $S_DIR complete at $D_DIR."
        
        #rotatiton : keep the last 3 backups
        
        B_COUNT=$(ls -dt "${B_DIR}"/backup_* | wc -l)
        
        if [ "$B_COUNT" -gt 3 ]; then
                ls -dt "${B_DIR}/backup_* | tail -n +4 | xargs rm -rf"
                echo "old backup removed, only the last 3 are here"
        fi

Set crontab -r
* 1 * * * * bash /home/ubuntu/day9/baskup.sh

  Thanks You...
