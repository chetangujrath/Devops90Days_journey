What is the difference between Main Branch and Master Branch?

The main branch and master branch are common default branch names in Git repositories, often used interchangeably, but there are some distinctions largely influenced by conventions and evolving practices:

Key Differences
Naming Convention:

Master: Historically, Git initialized repositories with a default branch called master. It was widely used as the primary branch in most Git repositories.
Main: In recent years, many platforms (like GitHub, GitLab, and others) have transitioned to using main as the default branch name instead of master, primarily to adopt more inclusive language.
Repository Initialization:

Older Repositories: Repositories created before this shift often still have a master branch as the default.
Newer Repositories: Most new repositories initialized on platforms like GitHub now use main by default, although users can configure the default branch name during repository setup.
Function:

Both main and master branches serve the same purpose: they typically contain the mainline codebase and reflect the most stable, production-ready version of a project.
Primary Branch Role: Whether named main or master, this primary branch is usually where the latest, stable code is merged after it has been tested and reviewed in feature branches.
Adoption:

The move to main as the default branch name has been widely adopted across the software development community, especially in open-source and corporate settings. This transition reflects a broader effort to use inclusive and neutral terminology.
